### progression Bar 
The progression bar adjusts the completion level regarding your efficiency
- If you complete a task, it increases proportionally to the number of tasks you input
- If you delete a task, it does not increase since this is not evaluated as improvement (sorry :) )
- If you don't complete or clear all the tasks, the progression bar will keep in mind the previous tasks you have completed or deleted to adjust the completion

### storage
There is a local storage management. 
- If you input a task and leave the browser before saving it, the previous input will appear on the input bar
- If you input tasks and leave the browser, they will still be in the local storage, don't worry !
